## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

My process consisted of:

-Creating the HTML skeleton, divs, classes, etc.
-Implimenting CSS Flexbox (usually do this last, but as it is largely design oriented, I prioritized)
-Giving it functionality with VanillaJS
-Cleaning up the code

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

One of the major things I learned is that it is much easier to create a 'hidden' class for the thank you component and removing that class when you want it displayed. I have been using React for long enough to where I forgot about this way of rendering.

### Continued development

This project was intended to focus on the design aspect of my front-end experience and ensuring I keep my CSS skills strong. With each project I take on, I try to focus on an area I feel needs more attention.
